Moving target defense has emerged as a critical paradigm of protecting a vulnerable system against persistent and stealthy attacks. To
protect a system, a defender proactively changes the system configurations to limit the exposure of security vulnerabilities to potential
attackers. In doing so, the defender creates asymmetric uncertainty
and complexity for the attackers, making it much harder for them to
compromise the system. In practice, the defender incurs a switching
cost for each migration of the system configurations. The switching
cost usually depends on both the current configuration and the
following configuration. Besides, different system configurations
typically require a different amount of time for an attacker to exploit and attack. Therefore, a defender must simultaneously decide
both the optimal sequence of system configurations and the optimal
timing for switching. In this paper, we propose a Markov Stackelberg Game framework to precisely characterize the defender’s
spatial and temporal decision-making in the face of advanced attackers. We introduce a value iteration algorithm that computes
the defender’s optimal moving target defense strategies. Empirical
evaluation on real-world problems demonstrates the advantages of
the Markov Stackelberg game model for spatial-temporal moving
target defense.
